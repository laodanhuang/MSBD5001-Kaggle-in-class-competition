Programming language: Python

Required packages:
numpy,pandas,xgboost,sklearn

How to reproduce the result:
I recorded down hyperparameters combinations and feature used for each training process. In the last two records I mentioned that they were used for my final result. To reproduce my submission(test.csv is one of my final submission), you can simply run the code(except for the gridsearchCV part), and then replace the parameters of XGBRegressor with the specific parameters.
